Introduction

Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects millions of people worldwide. Early diagnosis is crucial for effective treatment and management of the disease. This project focuses on using Vision Transformers (ViT) to analyze brain MRI images and assist in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.

The ViT model is a state-of-the-art deep learning architecture that has shown excellent performance in computer vision tasks. By adapting ViT to the problem of Alzheimer's diagnosis, we aim to provide accurate and efficient predictions based on brain MRI scans.

Dataset

To train and evaluate the Alzheimer's diagnosis model, we used a publicly available dataset. The dataset consists of brain MRI scans from individuals diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease as well as healthy individuals. The dataset is divided into training, validation, and test sets, ensuring proper evaluation of the model's performance.

Please refer to the dataset's original source for more details on data collection and usage guidelines.

Installation

Usage

To train the Alzheimer's diagnosis model and make predictions using Vision Transformers, follow these steps:

Prepare the dataset:
Place the training, validation, and test data in the respective directories.
Preprocess the data as required (e.g., resizing, normalization).
Run the training script:
css
Copy code
python train.py --data_path path/to/dataset --batch_size 32 --num_epochs 100
Evaluate the model:
css
Copy code
python evaluate.py --data_path path/to/dataset --weights_path path/to/weights
Make predictions:
css
Copy code
python predict.py --image_path path/to/image --weights_path path/to/weights
Results

We achieved promising results in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease using Vision Transformers. The model demonstrated high accuracy and robust performance on the test dataset, outperforming previous methods. However, it's important to note that this project is still a work in progress, and further improvements and fine-tuning are ongoing.
